### Quick Start

#### What is Midjourney?

Midjourney is an AI-powered tool that transforms text prompts into stunning visual images. By leveraging deep learning algorithms, Midjourney interprets descriptive text and generates high-quality images that match the given prompt. Whether you're an artist looking to explore new creative avenues, a designer in need of inspiration, or just someone curious about the capabilities of AI, Midjourney offers a powerful platform to experiment and create.

This guide provides a quick start to using Midjourney, from setting up your environment in Discord to crafting your first detailed image prompts.

#### Log-in to Discord

To use Midjourney, you'll need access to a Discord account since Midjourney operates primarily within the Discord environment.

1. **Create or Log-in to Your Discord Account**:
   - Visit [Discord.com](https://discord.com) and either log in with your existing credentials or create a new account if you don't have one yet.
   - After logging in, you can join the official Midjourney Discord server by visiting the Midjourney website and clicking on the "Join the Beta" button or by using an invite link provided by other users.

2. **Join the Midjourney Server**:
   - If you haven't already joined the Midjourney server, you can do so by accepting the invitation link found on the official Midjourney website.
   - Once you're in, you’ll find a variety of channels that help you learn more about Midjourney, share your creations, and get assistance from the community.

#### Use /imagine

The primary way to interact with Midjourney is through the `/imagine` command. This command allows you to input text prompts that describe the image you want Midjourney to generate.

1. **Navigate to a Channel**:
   - In the Midjourney Discord server, choose a channel designated for image generation, often labeled as something like `#newbies` or `#general`. These channels are where you will input your commands.

2. **Use the /imagine Command**:
   - To begin, type `/imagine` in the message input field. Discord will suggest the `/imagine` command as you type, which you can select.
   - After selecting the command, a prompt field will appear where you can type in your description of the image you want to create.

3. **Input Your Description**:
   - In the prompt field, enter a detailed description of the image. The more specific and descriptive you are, the better Midjourney can interpret and generate the desired image.

4. **Submit the Prompt**:
   - Once you’ve entered your description, press Enter. Midjourney will start processing the prompt and within a few moments, it will generate an image based on your input.

#### How to Use /imagine

To effectively use the `/imagine` command, it's important to understand how to structure your prompts. Here are some key tips:

- **Be Descriptive**: The more detailed your prompt, the better. Describe the subject, environment, lighting, mood, colors, and any specific styles or influences you want to be reflected in the image.
- **Use Parameters**: Midjourney supports various parameters that allow you to fine-tune your image, such as aspect ratio (`--ar`), quality (`--q`), and stylization (`--stylize`).
- **Experiment**: Don’t be afraid to try different variations of your prompt to see what works best. You can adjust wording, change parameters, and experiment with different styles to get the image you're looking for.

#### Take a Screenshot from Zebonastic.ai Instagram and Use the /describe Function

One powerful feature of Midjourney is the `/describe` function, which can generate text prompts from an existing image. This is particularly useful if you want to replicate a certain style or get inspiration from an existing visual.

1. **Find an Image**:
   - Visit the [Zebonastic.ai Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/zebonastic.ai/) and take a screenshot of an image that inspires you or that you'd like to create something similar to.

2. **Upload the Image to Discord**:
   - In your Midjourney Discord channel, upload the screenshot by dragging it into the chat or using the "upload" button.

3. **Use the /describe Command**:
   - After uploading the image, type `/describe` in the chat and select the command. Then, select the uploaded image as the input.
   - Midjourney will generate a text prompt based on the image, which you can use as is, modify, or simply study to understand how certain visual elements are described in text.

#### Input this Prompt in /imagine

Let’s go through an example to illustrate the use of the `/imagine` command.

**Prompt Example**:
```
"29w Rapunzel, Grimm's, full body, photography by Annie Leibovitz, hyperrealist, show finest tonal separations and very low noise with a natural and elegant look, richness, epic dramatic, Photorealistic, kinetic, Fujifilm Chrome filter style, close up shot, high details, editorial, action movement motion drama, Robert Mapplethorpe, soft light, legendary Noctilux M 50mm f/0.95 Leica M lens, detailed, 40s style, glamorous, and saturation use dark and light micro contrasts to create depth, captivating gaze, ultra high resolution, dynamic composition, backlight, vogue, daylight, clear, symmetrical, fashion cover, Cinematic lighting, focused, Fashion Magazine photography, fashion, Three point lighting chaos 5 s 750 q 5 upbeta v 5, front view full body shot, Iconic state of the art digital Full frame rangefinder photography Leica M11 60MP, sharp --ar 2:3"
```
In this prompt:

- **Subject**: Rapunzel, full body, inspired by Grimm's fairy tales.
- **Style**: Photography by Annie Leibovitz, hyperrealist with photorealistic and editorial elements.
- **Details**: High details, close-up shot, soft light, and a kinetic, dynamic composition.
- **Lighting**: Cinematic lighting with three-point lighting chaos.
- **Equipment and Quality**: References to specific camera equipment and settings, like the Leica M11 60MP, are used to influence the image’s sharpness and clarity.

This prompt is incredibly detailed, combining multiple elements to ensure a rich and complex image output.

#### Use /shorten to Find the Important Keywords and Try a Shorter Version and Compare it to the Original

Long prompts are powerful, but sometimes brevity is key. Midjourney’s `/shorten` command helps you identify the most crucial parts of your prompt.

1. **Use the /shorten Command**:
   - After entering a long prompt, use the `/shorten` command followed by your prompt text.

2. **Review the Suggestions**:
   - Midjourney will suggest shorter versions of your prompt that focus on the most impactful keywords.

3. **Compare Results**:
   - Generate images using both the original and shortened prompts. Compare the results to see how the reduction in detail affects the output.

For instance, a shortened version of the earlier prompt might focus on fewer details:
```
"Rapunzel, full body, hyperrealist, photography by Annie Leibovitz, cinematic lighting, Vogue style, soft light, high details --ar 2:3"
```
While this version is less detailed, it still captures the essence of the original prompt. This comparison can help you decide when to use a more concise prompt versus a detailed one.

#### Render it in 3:2 and 16:9 Aspect Ratios

Aspect ratio plays a significant role in the composition and final appearance of your image.

1. **Render in 3:2 Aspect Ratio**:
   - This is a standard aspect ratio often used in photography. To render an image in this ratio, add `--ar 3:2` to your prompt.
   
   Example:
   ```
   /imagine "Rapunzel, full body, hyperrealist, photography by Annie Leibovitz, cinematic lighting, Vogue style, soft light, high details --ar 3:2"
   ```

2. **Render in 16:9 Aspect Ratio**:
   - The 16:9 ratio is commonly used in widescreen formats like video and presentations. To render in this ratio, use `--ar 16:9`.
   
   Example:
   ```
   /imagine "Rapunzel, full body, hyperrealist, photography by Annie Leibovitz, cinematic lighting, Vogue style, soft light, high details --ar 16:9"
   ```

By experimenting with different aspect ratios, you can tailor your images to fit specific needs, whether it's for print, digital displays, or video content.

### Conclusion

This quick start guide provides a foundation for using Midjourney effectively. By understanding the basic commands, experimenting with prompts, and leveraging tools like `/describe` and `/shorten`, you can begin creating stunning AI-generated images that align with your creative vision. As you continue to explore and practice, you'll discover more advanced techniques that will further enhance your ability to bring your ideas to life with Midjourney.
